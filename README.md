## 📁 Structure

This project follows a flat file structure where:
- All `.php` pages and static assets (images, CSS, JS) are in the same folder.
- No framework or routing libraries are used.

---

## ❗ Why It's Archived

- This project is **no longer maintained**
- Image paths and assets are not optimized
- The structure does not match modern development practices
